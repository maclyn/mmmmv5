Navigate through the maze to grab the key and get back to the start.
----- CONTROLS ------
WASD (strafe) + mouse (look) + space (jump); Esc (pause/quit), -= (look sensitivity), Alt+Enter (fullscreen)
Left stick (strafe) + right stick (look) + A (jump); Start (pause/quit), Select (fullscreen)
----- DANGERS -------
Watch out for spikes, quicksand, the clock, and -- when you're running
back -- snakes. 
----- POWER-UPS -----
Jump through a portal to maybe get a boost forward to somewhere else
in the maze. Pick up coins for more points. Consult the (rare) maps on
the walls to find your way out. If you notice a bird, jump up to meet it
to get a shortcut to the key.
