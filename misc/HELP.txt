Navigate through the maze to grab the key and run back to
the lock in time to get to the next level.
### Dangers ###
Watch out for spikes, quicksand, and -- when you're running
back -- snakes. 
### Power-ups ###
Jump through a portal to maybe get a boost forward to 
somewhere else in the maze. Pick up coins for more points.
Consult the (rare) maps on the walls to find your way out.
If you notice a bird, jump up to meet it to get a shortcut
to the key.
